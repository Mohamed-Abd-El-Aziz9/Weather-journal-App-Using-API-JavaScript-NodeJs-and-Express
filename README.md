# Weather-Journal App Project

## Dsscription Overview
Weather Journal app is an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

### First Step

In the first step I begin with setup the server side by installing Express and Cors and test it by brinting message that gives the link of localhost with the port 3000. 

### the app.js 
tha main work in this section , i describe it as the core of this project , so i work on it with all my focus and i tried to describe and demond every single line of code with  comments to figure out to the reader what i am trying to do.


### modifing the UI
I tried to make to UI of the website more cleaner , focused , and comfortable for the eyes.

so I created my own UI for the project using #Bootstrap5 framwork. 

I am also used #Fontawesome framework to genrate so beauty icons 

when you run the server and open the website you will find that i hidden the content section that hold the main data,
that because i give it "d-none" class and remove it when the user enter the genratue buttton and add "d-block", its a simple tric that make the UI of the webiste more clean. 


### Finally 
finally I tried hard to make this project unique and explained well with comments, and acutally I learned alot of concepts from it , i hope you like it. :)

Thanks to Udacity teachers , tutors and all the reviwers for the hard effort they do for us :)
